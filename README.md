Python scraper is set up on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/),which accesses and updates data stored on npoint.

Further, the website is set up on github that accesses the data stored on [npoint](https://www.npoint.io/) to plot an ineractive heatmap based on number of articles published for a location.
